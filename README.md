# weather-outfit

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Get Started

* Go over to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/guide) to sign up for an API key.
* Go over to [LocationIQ](https://locationiq.com/register) to sign up for an API key.
* Create a `.env` file with the environment variables `OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API_KEY={your_key}` and `LOCATION_IQ_API_KEY={your_key}`.
* Run `npm install -g nodemon` to globally install `nodemon` to monitor your server.
* Run `npm install -g concurrently` to globally install `concurrently` in order to run both the server and client at the same time.
* From the project directory, run `npm install` to install server and client dependencies.
